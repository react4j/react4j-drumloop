# React4j DrumLoop

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/react4j/react4j-drumloop.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/react4j/react4j-drumloop)

An experimental drum machine UI derived from the [hooks-drum-machine](https://github.com/kenwheeler/hooks-drum-machine)
used to experiment with a few different Arez and React4j features. The source code has been vendored into
this repository and is available at [vendor/hooks-drum-machine](vendor/hooks-drum-machine).

The solution can be run through the GWT DevServer and is available at
[http://127.0.0.1:8888/drumloop_dev/](http://127.0.0.1:8888/drumloop_dev/) but it is assumed that you know
enough about Buildr/GWT/etc to get yourself to a running DevServer.
