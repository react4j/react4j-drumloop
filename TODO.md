# TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

* Publish output into GitHub Pages branch. Make sure repository url points at it and it is
  added to the readme. Also add link from Arez/React4j pages?

* Consider either moving `ReactCache` to react4j project. Also consider whether it should be re-implemented
  or just use a binding to underlying JS library. A reimplementation would be much safer and faster as could
  add more extensive invariant checking into it and also could DCE all unused code.

* Consider a refactor of CSS that uses sensible names for each of the CSS components.
